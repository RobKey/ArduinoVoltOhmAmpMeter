Arduino Volt Ohm Amp Meter 

 Need to check a voltage don't have a voltmeter just had a few lines of code and one analogue input to your project and you can check voltages</br>
 
This repo has basic easy to use volt, ohm, and amp meters that can be used to test you build and its components.</br>
It also includes complete multimeter combining all three functions</br>
</br></br>

 disclaimer any voltage is applied 2 the  Arduino bust must be within manufacturers specifications accessory voltages May damage your equipment</br></br>

this project came about because many people in the Arduino community ask for help to fix can you build, when asked to check a voltage they say "I haven't got a voltmeter"  I realised the analogue inputs could be used as a vol tmeter, ohm meter and amp meter with minimal setup and only a few lines of code the point where the volt meter can easily be incorporated into any running project with the use of 1 analog input and used to check voltages
